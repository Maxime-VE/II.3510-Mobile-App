# II.3510-Mobile-App-TP1

The objective of this first assignment is to familiarize yourselves with Android Studio and the
different tools that are shipped with the IDE. If you still haven't downloaded and installed
Android Studio, you will have to do it ASAP. Android Studio can be downloaded here:

https://developer.android.com/studio/

## Technical specifications
Important: The first thing that you should do is to create an 'Empty Activity' called
MainActivity. Be sure to check the box "Launcher Activity" when creating it. After that, you
should be ready to work on your assignment. You have to use JAVA
The specifications are detailed in the following section.

## Description of the App
In this assignment, you will manipulate basic widgets that we have seen during the first
lecture:
- Button
- TextView
- EditText

Your assignment consists in adding an item of each to the MainActivity, with the following
characteristics:

- The EditText will take the whole width of the Activity (minus small margins) and can
display texts spanning on several lines.
- The Button, once clicked, should update the text of the TextView so as to display
what was typed in the EditText.
- The TextView should present design attributes similar to the ones of the EditText. In 
particular, it should also be able to display text on several lines.
The look and design of the app is not important and won't be considered when grading
your assignment.
### Bonus:
1. Create Buttons to change the font color of the TextView
2. Create Buttons to change the font size of the TextView
